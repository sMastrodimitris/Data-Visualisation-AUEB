Present interesting findings on the region you worked on for the hands-on project. 
This time you should also incorporate the rest of the world in your analysis. You may also use other external data sources to enhance your analysis.

You must submit a report (in Word or other, submit it in PDF format) explaining the graphs and communicating your story in detail. 
In the report include an appendix outlining the contribution of each member of the team. Also submit all the files that you have used to create the graphs: processed data files, 
Tableau files, code, etc. If they are too big to be uploaded to e-class, provide (in the report) a Dropbox or similar link for us to download them.
