The scope of the project is to use the data (and perhaps any other
relevant and useful data) to study whether there is an increasing trend
for Greece or better whether the behavior of Greece is different than
the rest of the Europe.

You have to deliver the following:
- A presentation (powerpoint or pdf) with at least 10 static visualizations using R, to study the data and create your opinion about the topic in a full and convincing manner. No interactive plots can be produced in this part. The presentation must be self-contained: suppose that you will present it in front of an audience of mixed knowledge on the topic.
- at least 2 interactive plots using Tableau or R and a short presentation (powerpoint or pdf) explaining the interactive capabilities that you offer.
- The R code, Tableau files and data files needed to generate all the plots.
